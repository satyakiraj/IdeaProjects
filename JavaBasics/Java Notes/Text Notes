Class attributes are variables defined in the class.
To access the inner class, create an object of the outer class, and then create an object of the inner class.
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods.
